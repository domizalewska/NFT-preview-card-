## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The aim of the project is to present skills in html and css. Additionally, it shows the ability to use Flexbox technology.Thanks to this exercise, I consolidate my skills acquired on the Fronted Developer course financed as part of an EU project.

To see how you can add root, see below:


```css
:root {
--white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
--light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
--grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
--dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```


### Continued development

In the future, I want to focus more on CSS Grid technology and its understanding and use in tasks. Another goal will also be the development of the use of Web Accessibility.



### Useful resources
